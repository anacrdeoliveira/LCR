    "\n",
    "We learned that while we can compute a point estimate from a sample and evaluate its accuracy when we have access to the full population, real-world data analysis usually involves just **one sample**. Without access to the entire population, we can't construct the exact sampling distribution, making it difficult to measure how much our sample estimate might vary.\n",

    "Imagine you have a small bag of 10 marbles and want to know the average size of all marbles in the world. You can calculate the average size from your 10 marbles, but that doesn’t tell you how close your estimate is to the true average of all marbles. This is where **bootstrapping** comes in—it helps us estimate how much our average (or any point estimate) might vary if we could take different samples from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping works by **re-sampling** from the data you already have. By creating many new samples (by randomly selecting data points with replacement), we can build a **distribution** of *possible* estimates. This distribution helps us understand how much our estimate might vary and gives us a range of likely values, which we can use to assess the uncertainty around our sample estimate.\n",

Just like with the marbles, we only have one sample of listings, and we want to know how accurate our estimate (like the average price) is. By applying the **bootstrap** method to this Airbnb dataset, we can simulate many new samples from our original data and get a better sense of how much the average price might vary.\n",

    "6. **Repeat steps 1–5 many times** (e.g., 10,000 times). This creates many bootstrap samples and gives you a range of estimates, called the \"bootstrap distribution.\"\n",

This foundational knowledge will be crucial as you delve into more complex statistical analyses in the future! Here's a summary of what we covered:\n",
